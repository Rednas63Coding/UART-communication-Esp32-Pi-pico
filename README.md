# UART-communication-Esp32-Pi-pico
Esp32 communicating with Raspberry Pi Pico(Circuitpython) over uart.

This is an easy code for you if you dont know how to send data from Esp32 to Raspberry Pi Pico.
This code is not fully made by Rednas, I just found these and put togeather because I havent seen project like that.

If something is wrong with it please say I will try to fix it.
